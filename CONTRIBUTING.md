## Code of Conduct
Before contributing, please read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kao-xiang/mantou/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

---

## Getting Started
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub:
   - Visit [kao-xiang/mantou](https://github.com/kao-xiang/mantou) and click "Fork."
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mantou.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes and ensure they follow the guidelines below.
5. Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request.

---

## Conventional Commits
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to maintain a consistent commit history. This helps with automated changelog generation and versioning.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message should follow this format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### Types
- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `style`: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, linting).
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `test`: Adding or updating tests.
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency updates, CI/CD changes).

#### Examples
- `feat(router): add support for dynamic routes`
- `fix(server): resolve memory leak in request handling`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

---

## Versioning and Release Strategy
We use a GitHub bot to automate versioning and publishing based on **Conventional Commits**. Here's how it works:

### Version Bumps
- **`major`**: Triggered by `!feat` or commits with **breaking changes**.
  - Example: `feat!: remove deprecated API`
- **`minor`**: Triggered by `feat` (new features without breaking changes).
  - Example: `feat(api): add new endpoint`
- **`patch`**: Triggered by `fix` (bug fixes) on **stable branches** (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`).
  - Example: `fix(router): handle null routes`
- **`canary`**: Triggered by `fix` (bug fixes) on the **develop branch**.
  - Example: `fix(auth): resolve login issue`

### Important Notes
- Commits that do not follow the **Conventional Commit** format or do not include `feat`, `fix`, or breaking changes will **not trigger a version change**.
- Always include a clear and descriptive commit message to ensure the bot correctly interprets your changes.

### Stable vs. Develop Branches
- **Stable branches** (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`): Only `patch` versions are published for bug fixes.
- **Develop branch**: `canary` versions are published for bug fixes, allowing for testing without affecting stable releases.

## Pull Request Guidelines
1. **Keep PRs focused**: Each PR should address a single issue or feature.
2. **Reference issues**: If your PR fixes an issue, include `Closes #issue-number` in the description.
3. **Write clear descriptions**: Explain the purpose of your changes and any relevant context.
4. **Update documentation**: If your changes affect the API or usage, update the relevant documentation.
5. **Run tests**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR.

## Development Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
